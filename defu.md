# ***Reflection***

We first used **ChatGPT** to research formulas for an eco-friendly bug repellent spray, and then we used the AI to generate a code for a **style/format for our website**.

After we had the format down, we created another page and asked AI to generate a similar format/style.

Then we looked around on **Google** for background images that would appeal to the user.

We also used **Adobe Firefly** to generate images of the business products.

For the logo, we used a website called **Design.com**. We found a captivating image and tweaked the colors and added our **business slogan**.

We Continued to use **ChatGPT** to research further on pricing and formulas to provide more **information** about our products.

As we were finishing the website, we decided to use google to find a background which would relate to our products and after that we were finished.
